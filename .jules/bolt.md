## 2024-04-16 - MatchTicker React.memo Optimization
**Learning:** In a highly dynamic list of games where filters or parent states change, functional components that rely on filtering large arrays on every render (like MatchTicker) can cause unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, React.memo is not consistently applied to all components.
**Action:** Wrap MatchTicker in React.memo and useMemo for its internal derived data (upcoming games calculation) to prevent unnecessary re-computations and re-renders, especially since it only needs to re-render when the `games` array reference changes.
